To install dependencies run:

### `npm install`

In the project directory run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app has a different design for desktop/mobile devices. If changing the screen size using developer tools please refresh the page so everything loads properly.
